## Introduction

In finance, a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on 
the value of some underlying asset. Since the value of these two 
entities is inextricably linked, the relationship that links them has 
long been a subject of research, especially since quatitative analysis 
became so dominant in the field. Perhaps the most important developement 
in this area is the Black-Scholes (or Black-Scholes-Merton) model, which 
can be used to derive the price of a derivative, given that the rather 
restrictive assumptions of the model are met.
